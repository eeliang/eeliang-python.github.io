# Introduction

Learn to refer to the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) for basic knowledge.

For a bite-size walkthrough of concepts, I recommended [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming).

Lastly, you can seek help from online forums ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python), etc. ).
